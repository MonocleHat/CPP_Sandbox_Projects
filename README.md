# The CPP Sandbox
*What is this repo?*
A few years ago I often times would test my java code by running mini projects that were sandboxed off from my main module. This testing of projects was contained in various sandbox projects. the problem was that these projects were rarely organized and often scattered throughout my IDE and various backups.

In this case the repo will contain many different instances of mini projects and dumb things that I want to test in CPP. Future iterations will include a Python sandbox, and potentially a bash sandbox as well. 

Because I'm learning c++ still i might make some real stupid errors too. pardon my dust. any updates will be pushed to their respective repos.
